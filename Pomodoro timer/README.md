**The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to divide work into intervals, known as pomodoros, with short breaks in between.**

**In this implementation, I have set the work interval to 12 seconds and the break interval to 6 seconds. This cycle continues until the user presses the reset button or closes the screen.**
